# About Archipelag.io

**Archipelag.io** (pronounced *archipelago*) is the brand and domain for our sovereign compute platform. The name evokes an archipelago — a network of independent islands working together — which is exactly how our distributed compute fabric operates.

## Our Mission

We're building compute infrastructure that respects data sovereignty. Every organization should be able to run AI Cargos with full control over where their data is processed, who processes it, and how it's handled.

Sovereignty is not a feature. It's the foundation.

## The Problem

AI adoption is accelerating, but data sovereignty is falling behind:

- **Jurisdiction gaps** — Cloud providers process data across borders with limited transparency
- **Compliance burden** — Teams spend months navigating GDPR, AI Act, and sector-specific regulations
- **Trust deficit** — Organizations can't verify where their data is actually processed
- **Vendor lock-in** — Centralized providers control pricing, availability, and data access

For regulated industries — healthcare, finance, government — these aren't inconveniences. They're blockers.

## Our Solution

Archipelag.io creates a distributed compute network where:

- **Jurisdiction routing** ensures Cargos run in specific regions — EU, Switzerland, or custom zones
- **Verified nodes** are operated by attested providers with documented compliance capabilities
- **Policy enforcement** happens at the infrastructure level, not as an afterthought
- **Audit trails** document every execution for regulatory review

## Swiss and European Roots

We're built on the data protection heritage of Switzerland and the European Union. These jurisdictions set the global standard for privacy and data sovereignty. Our infrastructure inherits that tradition:

- Swiss Federal Act on Data Protection (FADP)
- EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)
- EU AI Act compliance readiness
- Data residency guarantees with no cross-border transfers

## Technology

Our platform is built on:
- **Rust agents** for efficient, secure edge computing with hardware attestation
- **Elixir/Phoenix** for the coordination layer with real-time streaming
- **NATS messaging** for reliable, low-latency job dispatch
- **Container isolation** with signed Cargos and seccomp profiles
- **Cryptographic verification** for node identity and execution integrity
- **Multi-Island compute** — pipeline parallelism shards large models across multiple Islands; batch fan-out distributes independent work in parallel
- **Compute Exchange** — market-based pricing with bid/ask matching and live rate snapshots
- **Cargo Marketplace** — developer portal with publisher tiers, reviews, ratings, and per-execution payouts
- **Mobile compute** — iOS agent with on-device LLM inference via CoreML; Android via ONNX
- **Workflow orchestration** — chain Cargos into DAG pipelines with conditional branching, retry, and templates
- **Inference caching** — semantic deduplication serves similar prompts from cache instantly (free)
- **A/B testing** — split traffic between model versions, measure quality, auto-promote the winner
- **Federated fine-tuning** — train models across Islands without centralizing data; differential privacy built in
- **Confidential inference** — TEE hardware attestation + AES-256-GCM encryption; Islands never see your data

## Security & Privacy

- **Verified providers**: Every node operator goes through identity and compliance verification
- **Signed Cargos**: Only network-approved containers can execute
- **Encrypted communication**: All traffic secured with mTLS
- **Confidential inference**: TEE attestation (SGX, SEV, TrustZone, Nitro) + end-to-end encryption
- **Hardware isolation**: Strict resource limits, sandboxed execution
- **Audit logging**: Complete execution records for regulatory review

## Team

We're a small team of distributed systems engineers with backgrounds in cloud infrastructure, data protection, and AI deployment. We believe the future of computing is sovereign, verifiable, and community-operated.
