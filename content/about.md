# About Archipelag.io

## Our Mission

We're building compute infrastructure that respects data sovereignty. Every organization should be able to run AI workloads with full control over where their data is processed, who processes it, and how it's handled.

Sovereignty is not a feature. It's the foundation.

## The Problem

AI adoption is accelerating, but data sovereignty is falling behind:

- **Jurisdiction gaps** — Cloud providers process data across borders with limited transparency
- **Compliance burden** — Teams spend months navigating GDPR, AI Act, and sector-specific regulations
- **Trust deficit** — Organizations can't verify where their data is actually processed
- **Vendor lock-in** — Centralized providers control pricing, availability, and data access

For regulated industries — healthcare, finance, government — these aren't inconveniences. They're blockers.

## Our Solution

Archipelag.io creates a distributed compute network where:

- **Jurisdiction routing** ensures workloads run in specific regions — EU, Switzerland, or custom zones
- **Verified nodes** are operated by attested providers with documented compliance capabilities
- **Policy enforcement** happens at the infrastructure level, not as an afterthought
- **Audit trails** document every execution for regulatory review

## Swiss and European Roots

We're built on the data protection heritage of Switzerland and the European Union. These jurisdictions set the global standard for privacy and data sovereignty. Our infrastructure inherits that tradition:

- Swiss Federal Act on Data Protection (FADP)
- EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)
- EU AI Act compliance readiness
- Data residency guarantees with no cross-border transfers

## Technology

Our platform is built on:
- **Rust agents** for efficient, secure edge computing with hardware attestation
- **Elixir/Phoenix** for the coordination layer with real-time streaming
- **NATS messaging** for reliable, low-latency job dispatch
- **Container isolation** with signed workloads and seccomp profiles
- **Cryptographic verification** for node identity and execution integrity

## Security & Privacy

- **Verified providers**: Every node operator goes through identity and compliance verification
- **Signed workloads**: Only network-approved containers can execute
- **Encrypted communication**: All traffic secured with mTLS
- **Hardware isolation**: Strict resource limits, sandboxed execution
- **Audit logging**: Complete execution records for regulatory review

## Team

We're a small team of distributed systems engineers with backgrounds in cloud infrastructure, data protection, and AI deployment. We believe the future of computing is sovereign, verifiable, and community-operated.

## Roadmap

- **Q1 2026**: Private beta with verified compute providers and jurisdiction routing
- **Q2 2026**: Verification program launch, expanded EU/CH coverage
- **Q3 2026**: Additional jurisdictions, compliance framework integrations
- **Q4 2026**: SOC 2 certification, AI Act compliance toolkit
