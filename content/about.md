# About Archipelag.io

## Our Mission

We're building a distributed compute network that connects AI users with nearby hardware owners, creating a faster, more affordable alternative to centralized cloud providers.

## The Problem

Traditional cloud computing centralizes resources in distant data centers, leading to:
- **High latency** from geographic distance
- **Expensive pricing** due to infrastructure overhead
- **Vendor lock-in** with limited provider choice
- **Underutilized hardware** sitting idle in homes and offices

## Our Solution

Archipelag.io creates a peer-to-peer compute marketplace that:

- **Reduces latency** by connecting users to nodes within 50km
- **Lowers costs** through efficient resource utilization
- **Increases privacy** with local processing and zero-knowledge execution
- **Generates income** for hardware owners through idle compute sharing

## How It Works

### For Users
1. Submit AI workloads through our web interface or API
2. Get automatically routed to the nearest available node
3. Receive streaming results with sub-100ms latency
4. Pay only for actual compute time used

### For Hosts
1. Install our lightweight agent on your PC
2. Set availability preferences and power limits
3. Earn automatically when your hardware processes workloads
4. Receive monthly payouts via Stripe

## Technology

Our platform is built on:
- **Rust agents** for efficient, secure edge computing
- **Elixir/Phoenix** for the coordination layer
- **WireGuard** for secure, outbound-only connections
- **Container isolation** for workload security
- **NATS messaging** for real-time coordination

## Security & Privacy

- **Zero-knowledge execution**: Hosts never see your data
- **Encrypted communication**: All traffic secured with mTLS
- **Signed workloads**: Only verified containers can run
- **Hardware isolation**: Strict resource limits and sandboxing
- **Regular audits**: Continuous security monitoring

## Team

We're a small team of distributed systems engineers with backgrounds in cloud infrastructure, cryptocurrency networks, and AI deployment. We believe the future of computing is distributed, private, and community-owned.

## Funding & Sustainability

Archipelag.io is bootstrapped and revenue-funded. We take a small platform fee (10-15%) from transactions to cover infrastructure costs and continued development. The majority of value flows directly to hardware providers and users.

## Roadmap

- **Q1 2026**: Public beta with GPU-based AI workloads
- **Q2 2026**: Image generation workloads and expanded coverage
- **Q3 2026**: Mobile app and additional model support
- **Q4 2026**: Enterprise features and custom deployments
